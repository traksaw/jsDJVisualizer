# ðŸŽ¤ Live Demo Setup Checklist

## Pre-Presentation Setup (30 mins before)

### Hardware Setup
- [ ] Connect Pioneer DDJ-REV1 to laptop via USB
- [ ] Launch Serato DJ Pro/Lite
- [ ] Configure Serato audio output settings
- [ ] Test audio routing (play a track, verify output)
- [ ] Connect laptop to projector/display
- [ ] Test display mirroring/extended desktop

### Browser Setup
- [ ] Open Chrome/Firefox (recommended for best performance)
- [ ] Navigate to the visualizer (`index.html`)
- [ ] Bookmark the page for quick access
- [ ] Test fullscreen mode (press SPACEBAR)
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs/applications for performance

### Audio Permissions
- [ ] Click "Start" button in visualizer
- [ ] Grant microphone/audio input permissions
- [ ] Verify Serato DJ appears in audio input dropdown
- [ ] Select Serato DJ as audio source
- [ ] Test with music playing - verify visualizer responds

## During Presentation

### Demo Flow Suggestions
1. **Start with Classic Mode** - Show basic 3-band EQ concept
2. **Switch to DJ Mixer Mode** - Highlight professional 5-band analysis
3. **Show Spectrum Mode** - Explain frequency domain visualization
4. **Demo Particles Mode** - Show creative coding possibilities
5. **End with Waveform Mode** - Display real-time audio data

### Live Controls Demo
- [ ] Adjust sensitivity slider while music plays
- [ ] Change colors using hue slider
- [ ] Click mouse to randomize colors
- [ ] Press 'F' to freeze colors
- [ ] Enable Performance Mode for clean view
- [ ] Use SPACEBAR for fullscreen toggle

### Talking Points
- **Web Audio API**: "This runs entirely in the browser using Web Audio API"
- **Meyda.js**: "Meyda handles the complex FFT math for us"
- **p5.js**: "p5.js makes creative coding accessible"
- **Real-time Performance**: "60fps graphics with live audio analysis"
- **Hardware Integration**: "Professional DJ equipment works seamlessly"

## Backup Plans

### If Audio Input Fails
- [ ] Use laptop microphone as fallback
- [ ] Play music through laptop speakers
- [ ] Demonstrate with pre-recorded audio

### If Performance Issues
- [ ] Close other applications
- [ ] Reduce browser zoom level
- [ ] Switch to simpler visualization modes
- [ ] Check performance stats (FPS counter)

### If Browser Issues
- [ ] Have backup browser ready (Chrome + Firefox)
- [ ] Test in incognito/private mode
- [ ] Clear browser cache if needed

## Post-Demo

### Q&A Preparation
- **"How does frequency analysis work?"** â†’ Explain FFT and frequency bands
- **"Can this work with other DJ software?"** â†’ Yes, any audio interface
- **"What about mobile devices?"** â†’ Works but performance varies
- **"Is the code open source?"** â†’ Yes, pure HTML/CSS/JS

### Code Walkthrough Points
- Audio input detection and Serato prioritization
- Meyda feature extraction setup
- p5.js visualization modes
- Real-time performance optimizations
- Frequency band calculations
