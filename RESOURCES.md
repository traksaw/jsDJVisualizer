# DJ Visualizer ‚Äì Resources and Learning Guide

This document is a curated guide to help you (and folks at meetups) quickly understand, run, customize, and extend the DJ visualizer project.

The project is designed for live performance using a Pioneer DDJ-REV1 (preferred) or other Pioneer DDJ hardware, with a focus on visualizing bass/mid/high frequency bands as complementary ‚Äúpuzzle pieces‚Äù of a cohesive visual.


## Project Overview
- Purpose: Real-time audio visualization for DJ sets with low-latency, hardware-first input.
- Core concept: Bass, mid, high frequency bands visually complement each other like mixer EQ bands, unifying into a single composition.
- Tech stack: Web Audio API + p5.js (with WEBGL), DOM-based spectrum bars.
- Hardware focus: Pioneer DDJ-REV1 (priority), any DDJ/Pioneer controller. Serato Virtual Audio is not used.


## Architecture and File Map
- `index.html`
  - Loads external libraries (p5.js, p5.asciify) and app scripts.
  - Declares UI: device selector `#audioInputSelect`, start/fullscreen buttons, visualization mode `#visualMode`, sensitivity sliders, EQ level meters, status area, two render containers: `#spectrum-visualizer` (DOM bars) and `#p5-canvas` (p5 WEBGL).

- `app/app.js` ‚Äî `DJVisualizerApp`
  - Coordinates lifecycle and UI: start/stop, fullscreen, device enumeration and selection, gain controls, keyboard shortcuts, FPS/BPM display.
  - Bridges audio data from `AudioProcessor` to `DJVisualizer` via `onDataUpdate` callback.
  - Functions to note: `init()`, `startAudio()`, `stopAudio()`, `populateAudioDevices()`, `switchVisualizationMode(mode)`, `updateBPM(bpm)`, `updateFPS()`.

- `app/audioProcessor.js` ‚Äî `AudioProcessor`
  - Manages Web Audio API graph and analysis.
  - Responsibilities: device listing, input selection, analyser configuration, spectrum/time-domain capture, band energy calculation, RMS, lightweight beat/BPM detection.
  - Functions to note: `listInputs()`, `startAudio(deviceId)`, `stop()`, `updateAudioData()`, `detectBeat()`, `bandEnergy(...)`, `getAudioData()`.
  - Design choices: tuned FFT size (1024), smoothing, disabled echoCancellation/noiseSuppression/autoGainControl for DJ-grade input.

- `app/visualizer.js` ‚Äî `DJVisualizer`
  - Renders visuals using p5.js (WEBGL) and DOM.
  - Two rendering paths:
    - DOM-based `#spectrum-visualizer` bars for the ‚ÄúSpectrum‚Äù mode.
    - p5 canvas in `#p5-canvas` for creative modes (particles, rings, waves, mandala, tunnel, galaxy, polygons).
  - Functions to note: `init()`, `updateAudioData(data)`, `draw(p)`, `updateSpectrumBars()`, `drawFloatingParticles3D()`, `drawFrequencyRings3D()`, `drawAudioWaves()`, `drawMandala()`, `drawTunnel()`, `drawGalaxy()`, `drawAudioPolygons()`.

- `styles/styles.css`
  - All UI styling, layout, z-index for layered DOM + p5 renders.


## Setup: Pioneer DDJ-REV1 on macOS
1. Hardware and OS prep
   - Connect your DDJ-REV1 via USB. macOS should recognize it as an audio input device.
   - Optionally set macOS Input volume and sample rate (Audio MIDI Setup) to 44.1kHz.

2. Browser recommendations
   - Prefer Chrome for most consistent `getUserMedia` and WebGL performance.
   - Safari generally works but may require explicit user gesture before audio can start.

3. Microphone permission
   - On first run, click ‚ÄúStart Audio‚Äù in the app to trigger permission.
   - If denied: check macOS System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone and enable your browser.

4. Device selection
   - The app auto-detects and prioritizes DJ devices (DDJ-REV1 first, then any DDJ, then Pioneer devices).
   - Use the ‚ÄúInput Device‚Äù dropdown to override. DJ devices are labeled with a üéß.

5. Gain staging
   - Use the EQ Sensitivity sliders for Bass/Mid/High to visually balance inputs from your mixer/controller.

## Visualization Modes
Defined in `index.html` (`#visualMode`) and implemented in `DJVisualizer`.

- Spectrum Bars (`currentMode = "spectrum"`)
  - DOM-driven bars in `#spectrum-visualizer` driven by `spectrum` data.
  - Always-on EQ meters (bass/mid/high) act as quick signal check.

- Floating Particles (`drawFloatingParticles3D`)
  - 3D particle field with frequency-colored spheres. Bass/mid/high impact movement, size, and alpha.

- Frequency Rings (`drawFrequencyRings3D`)
  - Rotating rings with band-specific color/intensity and audio-driven radius/thickness.

- Wave Forms (`drawAudioWaves`)
  - Three layered waves for bass/mid/high across the screen with different speeds and spacings.

- Mandala (`drawMandala`)
  - Hypnotic radial lines with band-aware coloring and stroke weights.

- Tunnel Vision (`drawTunnel`)
  - Depth-driven tunnel effect modulated by energy; syncs with beat pulse for impacts.

- Galaxy (`drawGalaxy`)
  - Starfield/nebula-like motion with frequency band colorization.

- Polygon Collage (`drawAudioPolygons`)
  - Beat-aware polygon bursts. Background isn‚Äôt cleared every frame to create an evolving collage.

All modes use the same band color semantics:
- Bass (20‚Äì250Hz): Red `this.colors.bass`
- Mid (250‚Äì4kHz): Green `this.colors.mid`
- High (4k‚Äì20kHz): Blue `this.colors.high`


## How Audio Data Flows
1. `AudioProcessor.startAudio()` builds the graph: `MediaStreamSource ‚Üí AnalyserNode`.
2. `updateAudioData()` fills `dataArray` (freq) and `timeDataArray` (time domain), computes:
   - `rms`
   - `spectrum` (0‚Äì1 normalized)
   - band energies via `bandEnergy()` ‚Üí `bass`, `mid`, `high` (smoothed)
   - `bpm` via simple peak detection over bass
3. `onDataUpdate(data)` callback in `app/app.js` applies slider gains and forwards to `DJVisualizer.updateAudioData()`.
4. `DJVisualizer.draw()` renders based on `currentMode` and `audioData`.


## Performance & Live Demo Tips
- Browser
  - Close unnecessary tabs and apps. Prefer Chrome in fullscreen.
  - Ensure ‚ÄúUse hardware acceleration when available‚Äù is enabled in browser settings.
- Audio capture
  - Keep `echoCancellation`, `noiseSuppression`, `autoGainControl` off (already done in code) for clean line-level input from the controller.
  - If the device is busy, close other apps using the audio device.
- Visuals
  - Use Spectrum Bars or Particles for the most stable frame rate on low-powered machines.
  - Reduce number of particles or FFT size if needed (see `visualizer.js` and `audioProcessor.js`).
- Latency
  - USB direct from DDJ-REV1 provides lowest latency and best signal quality.


## Troubleshooting
- ‚ÄúMicrophone access denied‚Äù
  - Allow in browser prompt. If still failing, macOS System Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone ‚Üí enable your browser.
- ‚ÄúNo audio devices found‚Äù
  - Check USB connection and cables. Confirm in macOS Audio MIDI Setup. Refresh devices in the app.
- ‚ÄúAudio device is busy‚Äù
  - Close other apps (Zoom, DAWs, browser tabs) that may hold the device.
- Selected device not working
  - App falls back from `exact` to `ideal` deviceId. Try another input or switch back to Auto.
- BPM seems half-time
  - The detector attempts to double BPM between 45‚Äì90. Verify kick clarity and input level.


## Extend and Customize
- Add a new visualization mode
  - In `index.html` add `<option value="myMode">My Mode</option>`
  - In `DJVisualizer.draw()` add a new case `"myMode"` and implement `drawMyMode(p)`.

- Integrate feature detection or more advanced onset/BPM libraries
  - Current implementation is custom and lightweight. You can optionally explore Meyda (feature extraction) to add spectral features, but it‚Äôs not required in this codebase.

- Map controller inputs (future)
  - For advanced setups, consider WebMIDI to react to DDJ controls and crossfader (if exposed via MIDI on your setup).

## Demo Flow (Meetup Script)
1. Plug in DDJ-REV1 and open the app.
2. Show device auto-detection (üéß tag) and start audio.
3. Highlight EQ meters reacting to bass/mid/high.
4. Switch modes (1‚Äì4) and explain how each band contributes visually.
5. Adjust sensitivity sliders to re-balance the look live.
6. Toggle fullscreen and walk through BPM indicator.
7. End by showing the Polygon Collage for a dramatic finish.


## BPM Detection Resources
The current implementation in `app/audioProcessor.js` uses a lightweight custom approach (`detectBeat()`) based on bass energy peaks with interval averaging and smoothing. For more robust or alternative BPM/onset detection strategies, these resources are helpful:
  - Meyda (feature extraction ‚Äì spectral flux, energy, etc.): https://meyda.js.org/
  - music-tempo (tempo estimation from onset arrays): https://github.com/ibbatta/music-tempo
  - web-audio-beat-detector (utility for BPM estimation via Web Audio): https://github.com/chrisguttandin/web-audio-beat-detector
  - Chris Wilson ‚Äì Beat Detection Using Web Audio: https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webaudio/beat-detection/ (archived)
  - aubio.js (onset/beat detection compiled to JS/WebAssembly): https://github.com/aubio/aubiojs
  - Essentia.js (comprehensive audio analysis in the browser): https://mtg.github.io/essentia.js/
  
Tip: You can keep the fast custom detector for responsiveness and overlay a slower, more stable library estimate to refine the displayed BPM.
